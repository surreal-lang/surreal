//! ToyBEAM - A toy BEAM virtual machine in Rust.
//!
//! This is a lightweight BEAM-inspired VM that can compile to WebAssembly.
//! It implements core BEAM primitives:
//! - Process spawning with parent tracking
//! - Message passing between processes
//! - Process links (bidirectional crash notification)
//! - Process monitors (one-way crash notification)
//! - Process registry for named processes
//! - Receive with timeout
//! - Cooperative scheduling with reduction budgets
